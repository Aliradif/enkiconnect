# üéÅ PlayConnect - Global Gift Exchange Platform

## **Business Concept Overview**

PlayConnect is a revolutionary gift exchange platform that matches users worldwide based on their payment contributions, creating unique cultural and social connections through thoughtful gift giving.

### **Core Mechanics**

1. **Payment-Based Matching**: Users contribute money (e.g., $25 CAD), get matched with someone who paid a similar value (e.g., ‚Ç¨18 EUR ‚âà $25 CAD), and each receives a gift worth their individual contribution amount
2. **Cultural Exchange**: International matching promotes cultural learning and global friendships
3. **Multiple Play Modes**: Different categories for various social contexts (world, company, friends, family)
4. **24-Hour Connection Window**: Brief chat period for cultural exchange and potential friendship building
