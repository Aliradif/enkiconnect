# 🎁 **Gift Exchange Logic - How It Really Works**

## **💰 Core System**

### **Individual Contribution Model**
- **You pay**: Your local currency amount (e.g., $25 CAD)
- **You receive**: A gift worth exactly what you paid ($25 CAD value)
- **Your partner pays**: Equivalent amount in their currency (e.g., €18 EUR)
- **They receive**: A gift worth exactly what they paid (€18 EUR value)

## **🌍 Currency Conversion Examples**

### **Example 1: Canada ↔ Germany**
- **User (Canada)**: Pays $25 CAD → Receives German-themed gift worth $25 CAD from Amazon.ca
- **Partner (Germany)**: Pays €18 EUR → Receives Canadian-themed gift worth €18 EUR from Amazon.de
- **Local Fulfillment**: All gifts ship locally - no international shipping!

### **Example 2: USA ↔ Japan**
- **User (USA)**: Pays $30 USD → Receives $30 USD gift
- **Partner (Japan)**: Pays ¥4,200 JPY → Receives ¥4,200 JPY gift  
- **Exchange Rate**: ¥4,200 JPY ≈ $30 USD (includes platform fees)

### **Example 3: UK ↔ Australia**
- **User (UK)**: Pays £20 GBP → Receives £20 GBP gift
- **Partner (Australia)**: Pays $36 AUD → Receives $36 AUD gift
- **Exchange Rate**: $36 AUD ≈ £20 GBP (includes platform fees)

## **🎯 Matching Algorithm**

### **Step 1: Amount Conversion**

- Match users with ±10% value tolerance
- Prioritize cultural/regional preferences
- Consider tier matching (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum)

- Purchase gifts locally in each user's currency
- Ensure equivalent value after all fees
- Account for local market differences
