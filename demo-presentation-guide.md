## **üéØ Investor Q&A Preparation**

### **Technical Questions:**
**Q: "How does the AI gift selection actually work?"**
**A:** "Our AI analyzes user preferences, local inventory via Amazon APIs, cultural relevance scores, and surprise factors. It queries multiple marketplaces simultaneously and selects gifts that match the exact budget while maximizing cultural authenticity."

**Q: "What about international shipping and customs?"**
**A:** "We avoid international shipping entirely. If a Canadian user is matched with someone from Germany, they receive a German-themed gift that ships locally from Amazon.ca. The German user receives a Canadian-themed gift that ships locally from Amazon.de. This eliminates customs issues, shipping delays, and international fees while still providing authentic cultural exchange."

**Q: "How secure is the payment system?"**
**A:** "All payments are held in escrow until gift delivery confirmation. We integrate with established payment processors and never store credit card information directly."

### **Business Questions:**
**Q: "What's your customer acquisition strategy?"**
**A:** "Network effects through friend/family invitations, B2B sales to companies for team building, and social media virality from surprise unboxing experiences."

**Q: "How do you compete with existing gift platforms?"**
**A:** "We're the only platform with fully automated AI purchasing, global local fulfillment, and the mystery box model. Traditional platforms require manual gift selection - we eliminate that friction entirely."

**Q: "What's your path to profitability?"**
**A:** "5% transaction fee on every exchange provides immediate revenue. With $45 average order value, that's $2.25 per transaction. At 10K transactions/month, that's $22.5K monthly revenue."

### **Investment Questions:**
**Q: "How will you use the $2M?"**
**A:** "60% technology development (AI improvement, more marketplace integrations), 25% marketing and user acquisition, 15% team expansion."

**Q: "What's your 5-year vision?"**
**A:** "Global platform processing 1M+ gift exchanges annually, integrated with 50+ local marketplaces worldwide, $100M+ annual revenue."
